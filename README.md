the project involves the process of setting up a complete CICD pipeline using various tools such as Jenkins , GitHub, Nexus, Docker, and Kubernetes. The scenario involves creating a pipeline for a client who wants to add a new feature to an application, which includes writing the code, testing it locally, and pushing the changes to a GitHub repository. The DevOps engineer then sets up the pipeline using Jenkins, which includes compiling the source code, running unit tests, performing a code quality check, and scanning for vulnerabilities. The application artifact is built and published to a Nexus repository for release management. The Docker image is built and scanned for vulnerabilities using Trivy before being pushed to a Docker Hub repository. The application is then deployed to a secure Kubernetes cluster after scanning for any issues using a tool called Cube Audit. Throughout the process, mail notifications for pipeline success or failure and monitoring using tools like Grafana are implemented. The cost for enrolling in the course is around 6,500 and includes access to recordings from previous batches and live sessions on weekends. The video covers setting up a secure infrastructure, creating a pipeline using AWS, and installing necessary tools and plugins such as Sonar Cube, Nexus, Docker, and Kubernetes.
